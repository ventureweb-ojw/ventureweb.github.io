What We Believe
===============

###Training
We believe in building websites that allow our clients to update and manage their online presence autonomously. That's why we build websites with customized administration areas, removing the complexity often associated with managing web content and user accounts. Beyond that, when a site is in the private launch phase, we undertake a number of training initiatives to ensure that our clients can indeed manage their site, and feel comfortable doing so, in an ongoing capacity.

In addition to training our client?s we recommend a Maintenance contract for all websites. Like any high value tool, websites need constant maintenance to keep them performing at their very best.

###Organic
Fifty-five percent of all online purchases originate from natural or organic search engine results. Our organic search engine optimization strategies are based on key objectives and use entirely ethical techniques available to professional search engine marketers. 

We have developed techniques that allow the engine crawlers to engage your entire site and maximizing site exposure and ranking. Positioning your website at the top of search engines in this rapidly changing search environment requires creative thinking, fresh quality content, multimedia and ongoing adjustments to ever-evolving search technology. Oh, and that's only the first step. Our continued focus on business development and integrated marketing keeps us focused on big picture, long-term SEO goals and solutions as trends and technologies change.

###Mobile &amp; Tablet
With Mobile overtaking Desktop as the primary browsing medium, there's no doubt that the mobile web is here to stay. Thanks to the proliferation of smart phones and tablets, people can access the web whenever and wherever they want. Mobile websites often offer the user a different experience than their desktop counterparts through the use of mobile-specific architecture and design. We understand what's needed to make your website usable for the mobile web and we integrate your site with online marketing strategies and tactics to drive qualified traffic to your mobile site.

###Branding
Nowhere is branding more important than online. In this increasingly cluttered and unmonitored realm of content and opinions, you not only need to effectively establish your brand, you must also monitor and reinforce it, as well. As a digital first agency, we believe that brands evolve over time and the look and feel of a brand is key to developing a solid web presence. Without it, consumers will end up doing the branding for you, whether you like it or not.

When we bring brands to life online, we work collaboratively with our clients to either refresh or develop the look, feel and tone. Our design team has extensive experience in logo development, typography and creative elements. Our strategic marketing team works with our client?s as well as the design team to develop the overall brand strategy through our Discovery process.

We ensure that your brand is not only captured on your website, but that anywhere and any way consumers interact with your brand further reinforces who you are, what you do and what sets you apart.

###UX
Although design is near and dear to our heart, no design is complete without a clear focus on User Experience. When we develop websites we are designing user experiences on the desktop, mobile and tablet. Your site speaks to a number of different audiences looking for easy access to a variety of content. Providing the right content to the right user is our focus.

Leveraging our team's unique strengths in SEO, responsive design and usability, we work to create distinctive, lasting designs without compromising marketability or usability
